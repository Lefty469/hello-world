self training on the use of github
i'm trying to learn more everyday.  I enjoy playing with technology, but have never made it to the point of using a github before.  The only app I ever made was for android, but I never published it.
I want to carry forward, and begin working on some home automation projects, and would like to make some devices and handlers for SmartThings, Alexa, and more.
I read that having a github would be useful, so here I am.
